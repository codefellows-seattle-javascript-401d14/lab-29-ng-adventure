Changing and sharing state using services and controllers

## Controllers
**Controllers manipulate scope specific to the component it's in,Handles the logic that manipulates properties and the view.**
**Set up the initial state of the $scope object.
Add behavior to the $scope object.**

## Services
**AngularJS only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.**
**Services provide scope that can be shared among components to help keep the code modular.**
