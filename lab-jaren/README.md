Changing and sharing state with services and controllers

- Controllers
  - Handles the logic that manipulates properties and the view.
- Services
  - Allows properties or data to be shared across components in the module.

The difference between the two is that controllers manipulate scope specific to the component it's in, whereas services provide scope that can be shared among components to help keep the code modular.
